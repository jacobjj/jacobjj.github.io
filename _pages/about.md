I am a Ph.D. student at the University of California San Diego, a member of the Advanced Robotics and Controls Lab ([ARClab](https://www.ucsdarclab.com/)) working under Dr. Michael Yip. I am also the treasurer for the [RoboGrads](https://contextualrobotics.ucsd.edu/robograds) student organization in UCSD. In my research, I study how we can leverage data to improve robot planning and control. My research interests include motion planning in uncertainty, transformers, reinforcement learning. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, swimming, and hiking. I also contribute to open-source ROS libraries.

If you are interested in working at ARClab, please send an email to [Dr.Yip](https://yip.eng.ucsd.edu/) with your CV and a short description of your interests. We have different projects to develop your skills in ROS, machine learning tools, and robot system development.
